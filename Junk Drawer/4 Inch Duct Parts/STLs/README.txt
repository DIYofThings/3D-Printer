This is a hasty readme,  

I printed all parts with a 0.6 nozzle and 0.3 layer height 3 perim -3top/bottom -20% infill
Printed on smooth PEI sheet for better seal between flanges. 

Uses 12x4mm N52 neodymium magnets
Use eopxy to glue in, be sure to check polarity before gluing! Hose flange magnets should be installed so they attract to magnets installed in window AND canister flanges. 
Window flange designed for coroplast window insert or similar thin material
Use one wrap of duct tape on carbon filter before installing filter flange for a good seal. 
Filter flange rings are meant to be glued on to window and filter flanges. I used acetone but epoxy will also work.
