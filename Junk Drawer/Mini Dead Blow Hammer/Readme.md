# Mini Deadblow Hammer
### Small but mighty hammer

This is a scaled down mashup of a watchmaker and deadblow hammer. The handle is best printed with a 0.6mm nozzle in a very tough filament like nylon. One cap is printed in nylon and the other is printed in TPU for varying striking surfaces. The caps are slightly undersized for TPU, a test print and scaling of the caps may be necessary depending on the material used. Screw one cap on then fill 2/3 full of lead shot or BBs, screw on the other cap and enjoy.
