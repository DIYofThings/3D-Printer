### DETAILS:
This 3D printed tension meter is designed to measure belt deflection to determine belt tension for Gates 6 and 9mm GT2 belts. The goal is to eliminate the need for phone apps that use frequency to determine tension and to provide an easily quantifiable and repeatable number to use when tensioning belts on a 3D printer. The repeatability and accuracy of this meter will be partially dependent on the build quality but you can expect  approximately ± 1.0N (0.25lb) accuracy on a carefully built and calibrated meter. 

Tested on the following printers: Voron Trident, 2.4, V.0, Salad Fork, and Switchwire.  Note: for other non listed printers please ensure you have clear access to at least 150mm of belt. This meter will not work on printers with belts that run inside of the extrusion channels.

### TOOLS:
 * M3 drill bit and holder 
 * ABS safe grease such as SuperLube Synthetic or Oatey/Harvey's silicone grease
 * 1.5, 2, and 2.5mm hex bit drivers. Ball end hex keys will likely give you a hard time here.
 * Toothpicks and Q-tips for applying grease
 * Hobby knife (X-Acto) 
 * Small flat needle file (optional)
 * Small triangular smooth cut file (optional for cleaning up gear teeth)
 * Cutter capable of cutting hardened music wire (don’t NOT use your nice flush cutters for this)

### PRINT SETTINGS:
 * Print in ABS for best results
 * Slide, needle and spring spacer components work best when printed on smooth or satin PEI
 * Layer height 0.2mm
 * 4 perimeters 5 top and 5 bottom layers
 * 40% grid infill 
 * 0.4mm nozzle with 0.4mm line width throughout 
 * No seams allowed on needle or slide gear teeth, use blockers or adjust seam settings in your slicer. 
 * Color change at layer 18 for Base and layer 43 Pivot for dual color contrasting text.
 * Your printer should be well tuned for this project (for example, able to produce a near-perfect Voron cube). Any PA issues or over/under extrusion will likely result in a poorly performing meter.
