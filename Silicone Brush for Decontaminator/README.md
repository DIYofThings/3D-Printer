# Silicone Brush Mod for Decontaminator

A silicone brush mod for the Edwardyeeks decontaminator and brush mod that can be found here: https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/orphaned_mods/printer_mods

This design uses an inexpensive silicone bracelete that is cut into 18mm long segments to form the "bristles" of the brush using the supplied cutting guides. The cut silicone pieces are then placed into the slots in the brush holder and secured via a M3x50mm socket head caps screw. Sharpening the tip of the M3x50 SHCS to a point with a file is recommended but not necessary. If you choose not to sharpen the screw you can simply pierce the installed silicone flaps using the hole in the cut guide first with a tack or other shrarp object to make installing the unsharpened screw easier.

Step 1.  Use the printed cutting guide to form the bristles. Print both guides and alternate 3 and 4 bristles segments in the brush holder.

The braceletes I used for this can be found here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09263TPL9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1  However any silicone bracelet measuring approx 12mm wide and 2mm thick should work. If you have a soldering iron it is a good idea to test your braceletes first to ensure that they are in fact silicone and heat resistant enough to use for cleaning a heated nozzle. They should not melt when touched with the tip of the hot iron.
