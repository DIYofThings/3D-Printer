# Silicone Brush Mod for Decontaminator

A silicone brush mod for the Edwardyeeks decontaminator and brush mod that can be found here: https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/orphaned_mods/printer_mods

This design uses an inexpensive silicone bracelete that is cut into 18mm long segments to form the "bristles" of the brush. The cut silicone pieces are then placed into the slots in the brush holder and secured via a M3x50mm socket head caps screw. Sharpening the tip of the M3x50 SHCS to a point with a file is recommended but not necessary. If you choose not to sharpen the screw you can simply pierce the installed silicone flaps first with a nail or other shrarp object to make installing the unsharpened screw easier. Once all of the flaps are in place and the screw is secured each flap can then be cut into thirds with a scissors to form bristles.

The braceletes I used for this can be found here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09263TPL9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1  However any silicone bracelet measuring approx 12mm wide and 2mm thick should work. If you have a soldering iron it is a good idea to test your braceletes first to ensure that they are in fact silicone and heat resistant enough to use for cleaning a heated nozzle. They should not melt when touched with the tip of the hot iron.
